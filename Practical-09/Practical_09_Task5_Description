By default, all the members of the structure are public. In contrast, all members of the class are private.
so to acess private memebers of the class we need functions whereas in sturucture we can directly access the memebers.
The structure will automatically initialize its members. In contrast, constructors and destructors are used to initialize the class members.
When a structure is implemented, memory allocates on a stack. In contrast, memory is allocated on the heap in class.
Variables in a structure cannot be initialized during the declaration, but they can be done in a class.
