in this task we are checking if a string is palindrome or not
he we are taking to iterators one starts with the first value of the string
and another has the last value
and we keep comparing them until the first iterator has value less than second
and if between this we encounter that the value stored in the iterators are not not equal then we break the loop
and change and thus we know that it is not a palindrome
