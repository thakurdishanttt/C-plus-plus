in this task we understand how string comapring function work
if we are comapring two strings a and b
then it compares its ascii values
so if it returns 0 this means strings are equal
if greater than one then a has a greater ascii value character 
if less then one then it has a lesser ascii value character
if they are both of different size then it returns the size difference of a and b
